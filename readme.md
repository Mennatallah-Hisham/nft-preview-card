## Hello, Frontend Mentor community. This is my solution for the NFT Preview Card challenge ðŸ‘‹


This is **challenge 3** where I provide comprehensive guidance to fellow developers by adhering to industry best practices. By focusing on key areas such as  
 - Semantic HTML
 - Clean web page structure
 - CSS enhancements
 - Accessibility
 - Performance Optimization

**Today I want to share with you the advantages of using utility css class**

- **utility class** are css classes that applies a single rule or a very simple pattern.  

**Benefits**
1. **dryness & consistency**
    - help you reduce repetition and unintentional inconsistency in your styling
      
    - you can alter the value in one place instead 

2. **file size**
   - by reducing repetition, you reduce the file size which results in improving your page performance.  

3- **specificity**

 - they also make it possible to creawte element specific overrides without writing high specificity varients.



 **Utility classes i used in this challenge**
 ```


.clr-white{
    color:white;
}

.clr-cyan{
    color:var( --color-primary-cyan);

}
.fw-2{
    font-weight:var(--weight-2);
}
.fw-3{
    font-weight:var(--weight-3);
}
.ml-2{
    margin-left:0.2rem;
}
.my-2{
    margin-block:2rem;
}
.my-1{
    margin-block:1rem;
}

 ```






I aim to **address common mistakes observed in the challenges submitted by other participants**. Through this initiative, I hope to not only solve newbie-level projects but also share valuable insights and tips to aid in their learning journey. As a part of this initiative, I started a series **Frontend Mentor - Learning from mistakes** on Linkedin where I share common mistakes I found in newbies / junior challenges to assist all fellow newcomers in avoiding these pitfalls
